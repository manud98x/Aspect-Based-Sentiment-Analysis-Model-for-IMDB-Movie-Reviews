# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Model for IMDB Movie Reviews Using DNN

This repository contains the implementation of an aspect-based sentiment analysis model using a neural network architecture. The model is designed to identify aspects within IMDB movie reviews and classify the sentiments associated with these aspects as positive, negative, or neutral. This approach is instrumental in exploring user opinions by evaluating sentiments tied to specific features or entities in the text.

## Features

- **Aspect Extraction**: The model identifies and extracts different aspects from the movie reviews.
- **Sentiment Classification**: For each extracted aspect, the model classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: The model leverages a neural network to perform the aspect-based sentiment analysis, ensuring high accuracy and performance.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the IMDB movie reviews dataset, a comprehensive collection of user reviews with varied sentiments.
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed performance evaluation with possible enhancements to improve accuracy and efficiency.
